## Your personal physiotherapist
**Consult your physiotherapist from the comfort of your home**

Our application is capable of detecting even the slightest motion of your muscles, helping you to complete your physio regimen to help you make the most of it. No more worries about over-straining or under-engaging your muscles. Our application is focused on delivering optimum power to aid you in your exercises and to help you become a better you.

We have releases with our binaries for the Raspberry Pi 4B. You can download them from the [Releases](https://github.com/satanb4/physionix/releases) section.
